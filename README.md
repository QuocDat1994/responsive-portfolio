A "minimalist" portfolio, yet still looks elegant in my opinion. The design is based on a tutorial of [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYzHS-n2gqU&list=PLillGF-RfqbYoGoCjKoMOkVznV6aSXKzU&index=1). That channel has good content about web development, so if you are a Frontend developer, you might want to check that out. 

Although the design is similar to that tutorial, my code is heavily modified as I want to recreate the website using my own skill and experience 👨‍🔧
